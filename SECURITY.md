## Reporting an Issue
If you do encounter an issue with the site, please create a new issue through the **Issues** tab.
These will get checked approximately every `1-3` days by the team at around 8PM AEST.
If we need more information about the issue we will reply to you and will most likely ask for a discord account to further talk.
Otherwise, we should be able to fix it without needing extra contact.

## Issue credit
If you do manage to get an issue that we do fix, your Github username will be added to a list of
"bug/issue finders" in the final credits of the site.
